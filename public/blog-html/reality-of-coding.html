			If you ask people how to learn to code, you'll often hear:
			<b>"Start with tutorials" </b> or <b>"Watch YouTube videos."</b>.While
			those are excellent starting points, they only scratch the surface of what
			software development truly entails.
		</p>
		<p>
			The true journey of coding begins when you decide to
			<b>build an application yourself.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			It's not just about typing syntax; it's about <b>problem-solving</b> and
			<b>system design</b>.

			The Reality of Development üõ†Ô∏è
		</h2>
		<p>
			When a professional developer sets out to build something, the first step
			is always analysis, not coding. They need to figure out the architectural
			plan before writing the first line of code.
		</p>
		<p>This process starts by defining two key elements:</p>
		<ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 pl-4 text-gray-300">
			<li><b>What needs to be built? (The features)</b></li>
			<li><b>What tools are required? (The tech stack)</b></li>
		</ol>

		<p class="mt-6">
			Then comes the essential <b>back-and-forth process</b> that defines real
			development:
		</p>

		<div class="p-4 border border-green-800 bg-gray-900 rounded-lg my-6">
			<p class="font-mono text-sm text-green-300">
				For example, when I build an app:
			</p>
			<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mt-2 text-gray-300 pl-4">
				<li>I started with the front-end (React).</li>
				<li>I coded each component individually.</li>
				<li>I connected each component to the back-end API.</li>
				<li>
					Then, I tested it. When an issue arose, I might have to modify the
					front-end slightly. If that didn't fit, I would realize I needed to
					change the back-end API's response structure.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">The Iterative Loop üîÑ</h2>
		<p>
			Real coding is a continuous, cyclical process‚Äîa loop of trying, failing,
			and adjusting‚Äîthat moves you closer to the desired outcome:
		</p>
		<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4 text-gray-300">
			<li>You take a feature or a problem.</li>
			<li>You figure out the steps required to solve it.</li>
			<li>You create a code structure.</li>
			<li>You test it.</li>
			<li>You find errors (bugs).</li>
			<li>You fix the errors.</li>
			<li>You test again.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="mt-6">
			Slowly but surely, that initial basic function or piece of code starts
			working.
		</p>
		<p>
			The most important takeaway? You only need to know what
			<b>output you want</b> . The " <b>how</b> " is something you figure out as
			you code, through this iterative, back-and-forth process.

				This critical skill‚Äîthis <b>problem-solving muscle</b> üí™‚Äîis rarely
