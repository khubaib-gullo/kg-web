# The Future of Serverless Computing

The landscape of cloud infrastructure is rapidly evolving, driven by the need for efficiency and scalability. **Serverless computing** (Function-as-a-Service or FaaS) is at the forefront of this shift.

## Key Trends

- **Edge Computing Integration:** Pushing compute closer to the user to reduce latency.
- **Stateful Serverless:** Overcoming the traditional limitation of stateless functions with new storage and database patterns.

### Why FaaS Matters

FaaS simplifies deployment, lowers operational overhead, and enables developers to focus purely on business logic.

This is where true optimization happens.
