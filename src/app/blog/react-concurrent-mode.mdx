This is a great, insightful description of the actual development process! Here is a draft for your LinkedIn post in English, structured to be engaging and professional:

## What is Coding, _Really_? ü§î

If you ask people how to learn to code, you'll often hear: "Start with tutorials," or "Watch YouTube videos." And while those are **excellent starting points**, they only scratch the surface.

The true journey of coding begins when you decide to **build an application yourself.**

It's not just about typing syntax; it's about **problem-solving** and **system design**.

## The Reality of Development üõ†Ô∏è

When you set out to build something, you first have to analyze the application and figure out:

- **What needs to be built?** (The features)
- **What tools are required?** (The tech stack)

Then comes the back-and-forth process that defines real development:

For example, when I build an app:

1.  I started with the **front-end** (React).
2.  I coded each component **individually**.
3.  I connected each component to the **back-end API**.
4.  Then, I **tested** it. When an issue arose, I might have to modify the front-end slightly. If that didn't fit, I would realize I needed to **change the back-end API's response structure**.

### The Iterative Loop üîÑ

It's a continuous, cyclical process:

- You take a **feature or a problem**.
- You figure out the steps required to **solve it**.
- You create a **code structure**.
- You **test** it.
- You find **errors** (bugs).
- You **fix** the errors.
- You **test** again.

Slowly but surely, that initial basic function or piece of code starts working.

The most important takeaway? **You only need to know what output you want.** The "how" is something you figure out _as_ you code, through this iterative, back-and-forth process.

This critical skill‚Äîthis **problem-solving muscle** üí™‚Äîis rarely taught in tutorials. It's developed over time, by wrestling with real-world problems and building things from scratch.

**That's where the real learning happens.**
